<h2>CANTO XXXII</h2>
<br>

<p>COULD I command rough rhimes and hoarse, to suit<br>
That hole of sorrow, o'er which ev'ry rock<br>
His firm abutment rears, then might the vein<br>
Of fancy rise full springing: but not mine<br>
Such measures, and with falt'ring awe I touch<br>
The mighty theme; for to describe the depth<br>
Of all the universe, is no emprize<br>
To jest with, and demands a tongue not us'd<br>
To infant babbling. &nbsp;But let them assist<br>
My song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid<br>
Amphion wall'd in Thebes, so with the truth<br>
My speech shall best accord. &nbsp;Oh ill-starr'd folk,<br>
Beyond all others wretched! who abide<br>
In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words<br>
To speak of, better had ye here on earth<br>
Been flocks or mountain goats. &nbsp;As down we stood<br>
In the dark pit beneath the giants' feet,<br>
But lower far than they, and I did gaze<br>
Still on the lofty battlement, a voice<br>
Bespoke me thus: "Look how thou walkest. &nbsp;Take<br>
Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads<br>
Of thy poor brethren." &nbsp;Thereupon I turn'd,<br>
And saw before and underneath my feet<br>
A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem'd<br>
To glass than water. &nbsp;Not so thick a veil<br>
In winter e'er hath Austrian Danube spread<br>
O'er his still course, nor Tanais far remote<br>
Under the chilling sky. &nbsp;Roll'd o'er that mass<br>
Had Tabernich or Pietrapana fall'n,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/32-301.jpg"><img alt="32-301b.jpg (32K)" src="images/32-301b.jpg" height="413" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Not e'en its rim had creak'd. As peeps the frog<br>
Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams<br>
The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,<br>
So, to where modest shame appears, thus low<br>
Blue pinch'd and shrin'd in ice the spirits stood,<br>
Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.<br>
His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,<br>
Their eyes express'd the dolour of their heart.<br>
<br>A space I look'd around, then at my feet<br>
Saw two so strictly join'd, that of their head<br>
The very hairs were mingled. &nbsp;"Tell me ye,<br>
Whose bosoms thus together press," said I,<br>
"Who are ye?" &nbsp;At that sound their necks they bent,<br>
And when their looks were lifted up to me,<br>
Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,<br>
Distill'd upon their lips, and the frost bound<br>
The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.<br>
Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos'd up<br>
So stoutly. &nbsp;Whence like two enraged goats<br>
They clash'd together; them such fury seiz'd.<br>
<br>And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,<br>
Exclaim'd, still looking downward: "Why on us<br>
Dost speculate so long? &nbsp;If thou wouldst know<br>
Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave<br>
Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own<br>
Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves.<br>
They from one body issued; and throughout<br>
Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade<br>
More worthy in congealment to be fix'd,<br>
Not him, whose breast and shadow Arthur's land<br>
At that one blow dissever'd, not Focaccia,<br>
No not this spirit, whose o'erjutting head<br>
Obstructs my onward view: he bore the name<br>
Of Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,<br>
Well knowest who he was: and to cut short<br>
All further question, in my form behold<br>
What once was Camiccione. &nbsp;I await<br>
Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt<br>
Shall wash out mine." &nbsp;A thousand visages<br>
Then mark'd I, which the keen and eager cold<br>
Had shap'd into a doggish grin; whence creeps<br>
A shiv'ring horror o'er me, at the thought<br>
Of those frore shallows. &nbsp;While we journey'd on<br>
Toward the middle, at whose point unites<br>
All heavy substance, and I trembling went<br>
Through that eternal chillness, I know not<br>
If will it were or destiny, or chance,<br>
But, passing 'midst the heads, my foot did strike<br>
With violent blow against the face of one.<br>
<br>"Wherefore dost bruise me?" weeping, he exclaim'd,<br>
"Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge<br>
For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?"<br>
<br>I thus: "Instructor, now await me here,<br>
That I through him may rid me of my doubt.<br>
Thenceforth what haste thou wilt." &nbsp;The teacher paus'd,<br>
And to that shade I spake, who bitterly<br>
Still curs'd me in his wrath. &nbsp;"What art thou, speak,<br>
That railest thus on others?" &nbsp;He replied:<br>
"Now who art thou, that smiting others' cheeks<br>
Through Antenora roamest, with such force<br>
As were past suff'rance, wert thou living still?"<br>
<br>"And I am living, to thy joy perchance,"<br>
Was my reply, "if fame be dear to thee,<br>
That with the rest I may thy name enrol."<br>
<br>"The contrary of what I covet most,"<br>
Said he, "thou tender'st: hence; nor vex me more.<br>
Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale."<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/32-305.jpg"><img alt="32-305b.jpg (40K)" src="images/32-305b.jpg" height="406" width="489"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:<br>
"Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here."<br>
<br>"Rend all away," he answer'd, "yet for that<br>
I will not tell nor show thee who I am,<br>
Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times."<br>
<br>Now I had grasp'd his tresses, and stript off<br>
More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes<br>
Drawn in and downward, when another cried,<br>
"What ails thee, Bocca? &nbsp;Sound not loud enough<br>
Thy chatt'ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?<br>
"What devil wrings thee?"&mdash;"Now," said I, "be dumb,<br>
Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee<br>
True tidings will I bear."&mdash;"Off," he replied,<br>
"Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence<br>
To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,<br>
Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman's gold.<br>
'Him of Duera,' thou canst say, 'I mark'd,<br>
Where the starv'd sinners pine.' &nbsp;If thou be ask'd<br>
What other shade was with them, at thy side<br>
Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain'd<br>
The biting axe of Florence. &nbsp;Farther on,<br>
If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,<br>
With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him<br>
Who op'd Faenza when the people slept."<br>
<br>We now had left him, passing on our way,<br>
When I beheld two spirits by the ice<br>
Pent in one hollow, that the head of one<br>
Was cowl unto the other; and as bread<br>
Is raven'd up through hunger, th' uppermost<br>
Did so apply his fangs to th' other's brain,<br>
Where the spine joins it. &nbsp;Not more furiously<br>
On Menalippus' temples Tydeus gnaw'd,<br>
Than on that skull and on its garbage he.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/32-309.jpg"><img alt="32-309b.jpg (53K)" src="images/32-309b.jpg" height="412" width="492"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"O thou who show'st so beastly sign of hate<br>
'Gainst him thou prey'st on, let me hear," said I<br>
"The cause, on such condition, that if right<br>
Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,<br>
And what the colour of his sinning was,<br>
I may repay thee in the world above,<br>
If that, wherewith I speak be moist so long."</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXXIII</h2>
<br>

<p>HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast,<br>
That sinner wip'd them on the hairs o' th' head,<br>
Which he behind had mangled, then began:<br>
"Thy will obeying, I call up afresh<br>
Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings<br>
My heart, or ere I tell on't. But if words,<br>
That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear<br>
Fruit of eternal infamy to him,<br>
The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once<br>
Shalt see me speak and weep. &nbsp;Who thou mayst be<br>
I know not, nor how here below art come:<br>
But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,<br>
When I do hear thee. &nbsp;Know I was on earth<br>
Count Ugolino, and th' Archbishop he<br>
Ruggieri. &nbsp;Why I neighbour him so close,<br>
Now list. &nbsp;That through effect of his ill thoughts<br>
In him my trust reposing, I was ta'en<br>
And after murder'd, need is not I tell.<br>
What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,<br>
How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,<br>
And know if he have wrong'd me. &nbsp;A small grate<br>
Within that mew, which for my sake the name<br>
Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,<br>
Already through its opening sev'ral moons<br>
Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,<br>
That from the future tore the curtain off.<br>
This one, methought, as master of the sport,<br>
Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps<br>
Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight<br>
Of Lucca to the Pisan. &nbsp;With lean brachs<br>
Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd<br>
Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.<br>
After short course the father and the sons<br>
Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw<br>
The sharp tusks gore their sides. &nbsp;When I awoke<br>
Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard<br>
My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask<br>
For bread. &nbsp;Right cruel art thou, if no pang<br>
Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;<br>
And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?<br>
Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near<br>
When they were wont to bring us food; the mind<br>
Of each misgave him through his dream, and I<br>
Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up<br>
The' horrible tower: whence uttering not a word<br>
I look'd upon the visage of my sons.<br>
I wept not: so all stone I felt within.<br>
They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:<br>
'Thou lookest so! &nbsp;Father what ails thee?' &nbsp;Yet<br>
I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day<br>
Nor the next night, until another sun<br>
Came out upon the world. &nbsp;When a faint beam<br>
Had to our doleful prison made its way,<br>
And in four countenances I descry'd<br>
The image of my own, on either hand<br>
Through agony I bit, and they who thought<br>
I did it through desire of feeding, rose<br>
O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve<br>
Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st<br>
These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/33-313.jpg"><img alt="33-313b.jpg (43K)" src="images/33-313b.jpg" height="407" width="489"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


And do thou strip them off from us again.'<br>
Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down<br>
My spirit in stillness. &nbsp;That day and the next<br>
We all were silent. &nbsp;Ah, obdurate earth!<br>
Why open'dst not upon us? &nbsp;When we came<br>
To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet<br>
Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help<br>
For me, my father!' &nbsp;There he died, and e'en<br>
Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three<br>
Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/33-315.jpg"><img alt="33-315b.jpg (44K)" src="images/33-315b.jpg" height="405" width="492"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope<br>
Over them all, and for three days aloud<br>
Call'd on them who were dead. &nbsp;Then fasting got<br>
The mastery of grief." &nbsp;Thus having spoke,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/33-317.jpg"><img alt="33-317b.jpg (43K)" src="images/33-317b.jpg" height="400" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth<br>
He fasten'd, like a mastiff's 'gainst the bone<br>
Firm and unyielding. &nbsp;Oh thou Pisa! shame<br>
Of all the people, who their dwelling make<br>
In that fair region, where th' Italian voice<br>
Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack<br>
To punish, from their deep foundations rise<br>
Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up<br>
The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee<br>
May perish in the waters! &nbsp;What if fame<br>
Reported that thy castles were betray'd<br>
By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou<br>
To stretch his children on the rack. &nbsp;For them,<br>
Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair<br>
Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,<br>
Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make<br>
Uncapable of guilt. &nbsp;Onward we pass'd,<br>
Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice<br>
Not on their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd.<br>
<br>There very weeping suffers not to weep;<br>
For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds<br>
Impediment, and rolling inward turns<br>
For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears<br>
Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show,<br>
Under the socket brimming all the cup.<br>
<br>Now though the cold had from my face dislodg'd<br>
Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me seem'd<br>
Some breath of wind I felt. &nbsp;"Whence cometh this,"<br>
Said I, "my master? &nbsp;Is not here below<br>
All vapour quench'd?"&mdash;"'Thou shalt be speedily,"<br>
He answer'd, "where thine eye shall tell thee whence<br>
The cause descrying of this airy shower."<br>
<br>Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn'd:<br>
"O souls so cruel! that the farthest post<br>
Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove<br>
The harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief<br>
Impregnate at my heart, some little space<br>
Ere it congeal again!" &nbsp;I thus replied:<br>
"Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;<br>
And if I extricate thee not, far down<br>
As to the lowest ice may I descend!"<br>
<br>"The friar Alberigo," answered he,<br>
"Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd<br>
Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date<br>
More luscious for my fig."&mdash;"Hah!" &nbsp;I exclaim'd,<br>
"Art thou too dead!"&mdash;"How in the world aloft<br>
It fareth with my body," answer'd he,<br>
"I am right ignorant. &nbsp;Such privilege<br>
Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul<br>
Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc'd.<br>
And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly<br>
The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes,<br>
Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,<br>
As I did, yields her body to a fiend<br>
Who after moves and governs it at will,<br>
Till all its time be rounded; headlong she<br>
Falls to this cistern. &nbsp;And perchance above<br>
Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,<br>
Who here behind me winters. &nbsp;Him thou know'st,<br>
If thou but newly art arriv'd below.<br>
The years are many that have pass'd away,<br>
Since to this fastness Branca Doria came."<br>
<br>"Now," answer'd I, "methinks thou mockest me,<br>
For Branca Doria never yet hath died,<br>
But doth all natural functions of a man,<br>
Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."<br>
<br>He thus: "Not yet unto that upper foss<br>
By th' evil talons guarded, where the pitch<br>
Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach'd,<br>
When this one left a demon in his stead<br>
In his own body, and of one his kin,<br>
Who with him treachery wrought. &nbsp;But now put forth<br>
Thy hand, and ope mine eyes." &nbsp;I op'd them not.<br>
Ill manners were best courtesy to him.<br>
<br>Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,<br>
With every foulness stain'd, why from the earth<br>
Are ye not cancel'd? &nbsp;Such an one of yours<br>
I with Romagna's darkest spirit found,<br>
As for his doings even now in soul<br>
Is in Cocytus plung'd, and yet doth seem<br>
In body still alive upon the earth.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXXIV</h2>
<br>

<p>"THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth<br>
Towards us; therefore look," so spake my guide,<br>
"If thou discern him." &nbsp;As, when breathes a cloud<br>
Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night<br>
Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far<br>
A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,<br>
Such was the fabric then methought I saw,<br>
<br>To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew<br>
Behind my guide: no covert else was there.<br>
<br>Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain<br>
Record the marvel) where the souls were all<br>
Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass<br>
Pellucid the frail stem. &nbsp;Some prone were laid,<br>
Others stood upright, this upon the soles,<br>
That on his head, a third with face to feet<br>
Arch'd like a bow. &nbsp;When to the point we came,<br>
Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see<br>
The creature eminent in beauty once,<br>
He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/34-323.jpg"><img alt="34-323b.jpg (44K)" src="images/34-323b.jpg" height="404" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"Lo!" &nbsp;he exclaim'd, "lo Dis! and lo the place,<br>
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."<br>
<br>How frozen and how faint I then became,<br>
Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,<br>
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.<br>
I was not dead nor living. &nbsp;Think thyself<br>
If quick conception work in thee at all,<br>
How I did feel. &nbsp;That emperor, who sways<br>
The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice<br>
Stood forth; and I in stature am more like<br>
A giant, than the giants are in his arms.<br>
Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits<br>
With such a part. &nbsp;If he were beautiful<br>
As he is hideous now, and yet did dare<br>
To scowl upon his Maker, well from him<br>
May all our mis'ry flow. &nbsp;Oh what a sight!<br>
How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy<br>
Upon his head three faces: one in front<br>
Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this<br>
Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;<br>
The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left<br>
To look on, such as come from whence old Nile<br>
Stoops to the lowlands. &nbsp;Under each shot forth<br>
Two mighty wings, enormous as became<br>
A bird so vast. &nbsp;Sails never such I saw<br>
Outstretch'd on the wide sea. &nbsp;No plumes had they,<br>
But were in texture like a bat, and these<br>
He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still<br>
Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth<br>
Was frozen. &nbsp;At six eyes he wept: the tears<br>
Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.<br>
At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd<br>
Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three<br>
Were in this guise tormented. &nbsp;But far more<br>
Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd<br>
By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back<br>
Was stript of all its skin. &nbsp;"That upper spirit,<br>
Who hath worse punishment," so spake my guide,<br>
"Is Judas, he that hath his head within<br>
And plies the feet without. &nbsp;Of th' other two,<br>
Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw<br>
Who hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe<br>
And speaks not! &nbsp;Th' other Cassius, that appears<br>
So large of limb. &nbsp;But night now re-ascends,<br>
And it is time for parting. &nbsp;All is seen."<br>
<br>I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;<br>
And noting time and place, he, when the wings<br>
Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,<br>
And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd<br>
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.<br>
<br>Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh<br>
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,<br>
My leader there with pain and struggling hard<br>
Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,<br>
And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,<br>
That into hell methought we turn'd again.<br>
<br>"Expect that by such stairs as these," thus spake<br>
The teacher, panting like a man forespent,<br>
"We must depart from evil so extreme."<br>
Then at a rocky opening issued forth,<br>
And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd<br>
With wary step my side. &nbsp;I rais'd mine eyes,<br>
Believing that I Lucifer should see<br>
Where he was lately left, but saw him now<br>
With legs held upward. &nbsp;Let the grosser sort,<br>
Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,<br>
Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then.<br>
<br>"Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet.<br>
The way is long, and much uncouth the road;<br>
And now within one hour and half of noon<br>
The sun returns." &nbsp;It was no palace-hall<br>
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,<br>
But natural dungeon where ill footing was<br>
And scant supply of light. &nbsp;"Ere from th' abyss<br>
I sep'rate," thus when risen I began,<br>
"My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free<br>
From error's thralldom. &nbsp;Where is now the ice?<br>
How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?<br>
And how from eve to morn in space so brief<br>
Hath the sun made his transit?" &nbsp;He in few<br>
Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still<br>
On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd<br>
Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.<br>
Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I<br>
Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass<br>
That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd<br>
All heavy substance. &nbsp;Thou art now arriv'd<br>
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,<br>
Which the great continent doth overspread,<br>
And underneath whose canopy expir'd<br>
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.<br>
Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,<br>
Whose other aspect is Judecca. &nbsp;Morn<br>
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,<br>
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,<br>
As at the first. &nbsp;On this part he fell down<br>
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,<br>
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,<br>
And to our hemisphere retir'd. &nbsp;Perchance<br>
To shun him was the vacant space left here<br>
By what of firm land on this side appears,<br>
That sprang aloof." &nbsp;There is a place beneath,<br>
From Belzebub as distant, as extends<br>
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,<br>
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends<br>
This way along the hollow of a rock,<br>
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,<br>
The wave hath eaten. &nbsp;By that hidden way<br>
My guide and I did enter, to return<br>
To the fair world: and heedless of repose<br>
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,<br>
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n<br>
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:<br>
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
